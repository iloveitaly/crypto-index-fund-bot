* https://algotrading101.com/learn/binance-python-api-guide/
* https://github.com/timggraf/crypto-index-bot seems to have details about binance errors. Need to handle more error types
* Offer a SME-based index?
  * https://taapi.io
  * Calculate on our own using klines and https://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/
* Think about multiple exchanges to get more lower-value tokens in the index
  * Refactor binance-specific stuff out of the market_buy logic
  * Define minimum API requirements for a new exchange
  * Which exchange has the most tokens, reasonable fees, and mostly trustworthy?
* Play around with purchasing at different points in the order book when using a limit strategy
  * Inspect market depth to help determine the most realistic low price to purchase at

# System
* Tie to postgres database to run for multiple individual users?
  * Add django for ORM
* Add sentry for error reporting
* Conditionally load up rich depending on the env

# Docker
* JSON external assets in docker
  * Can we use cointracker to get external portfolio data?
* Build a docker-compose file for this so it's easy to run as a cron job on a raspberry pi.

# CI / Python

* Python linter?
* Github actions for mypy?
* Fix typing errors, mostly with the typed dicts
* GitHub workflow for basic tests
* Black for code formatting
* Add cassettes for tests
