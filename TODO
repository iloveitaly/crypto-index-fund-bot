Next:

* https://github.com/timggraf/crypto-index-bot seems to have details about binance errors. Need to handle more error types
* https://github.com/leoncvlt/cryptodex build index via square root? Should we do this?
* Build a docker-compose file for this so it's easy to run as a cron job on a raspberry pi.
* Think about multiple exchanges to get more lower-value tokens in the index
  * Define minimum API requirements for a new exchange
  * Which exchange has the most tokens, reasonable fees, and mostly trustworthy?
* Can we use a LIMIT order at the bottom of the current order market?

Ideas:
* Can we use cointracker to get external portfolio data?
* Tie to postgres database to run for multiple individual users?

Python ideas:
* Python linter?
* Github actions for mypy?
